# Mod-5 Workday Schedule


## User Story

The purpose of this exercise is to demostrate my understanding of JS and Jquery by dynamically fielding styles and text to the index.html file. Specifically, by being able to add text/tasks to time slots for daily planner. Additionally, the use of local storage was utilized to save/store information entered into the scheduler and then reload that information on page refresh. All of the Acceptance Criteria below was met. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
